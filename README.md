# Riemann Sums Visualization
Tool for calculating and visualizing Riemann sums for a given function on a given bound.

## To-do:
- [x] padding around graph
- [x] midpoint sum
- [x] variable function
- [x] simple UI controls, scaling text
- [x] could use noloop(), only redraw on slider change?
- [x] separate grid lines and labels (lines behind, labels in front)
- [x] readme.md
- [x] handle prompt cancel
- [x] autoscale on window resize
- [x] check for e and pi in entered bounds
- [x] fix exta // missing (?) point bug
- [x] change bound entry to signed values, allow for [+a, +b] and [-a, -b]
- [x] rename domain/range to domain/range
- [ ] floating point precision (small #s) [detect magnitude on bound entry?]
- [ ] validation for bounds and f(x) input
- [ ] rewrite hastily crafted button class (pls), dolan suggestions
- [ ] add buttons for changing tick #, type, n, and function
- [ ] implement own text entry / dialog for f(x) prompt
- [ ] 'usable' on mobile
- [ ] display active function
- [ ] draw labels inside of graph view
- [ ] line length...
